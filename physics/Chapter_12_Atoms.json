   "notes": "<strong>8. Bohr’s Theory of Hydrogen Atom</strong> Bohr combined classical and early quantum concepts and gave his theory in the form of three postulates. These are<br>\n(i) Bohr’s first postulate was that an electron in an atom could revolve in certain stable orbits without the emission of radiant energy, contrary to the predictions of electromagnetic theory.<br>\n(ii) Bohr’s second postulate defines these stable orbits. This postulate states that the electron revolves around the nucleus only in those orbits for which the angular momentum is some integral multiple of h/2π, where h is the Planck’s constant (= 6.6 x 10<sup>-34</sup> J – s). Thus, the angular momentum (L) of the orbiting electron is<br>\nquantised, i. e. L = nh/2π<br>\nAs, angular momentum of electron (L) = mvr<br>\n∴ For any permitted (stationary) orbit, mvr = nh/2π<br>\nwhere, n = any positive integer i.e. 1, 2, 3, ….<br>\nIt is also called principal quantum number.<br>\n(iii) Bohr’s third postulate states that an electron might make a transition from one of its specified non-radiating orbits to another of lower energy. When it does so, a photon is emitted having energy equal to the energy difference between the initial and final states.<br>\nThe frequency of the emitted photon is then given by<br>\nhv – E<sub>i</sub>– E<sub>f&nbsp;</sub><br>\nwhere, E<sub>i</sub> and E<sub>f&nbsp;</sub> are the energies of the initial and final states and E<sub>i&nbsp;</sub>&gt; E<sub>f&nbsp;</sub>."
